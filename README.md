# My Portfolio



## Description

Here is a refactored webpage that took old styles of HTML coding and repetative CSS codes to smaller files size and clearer semantics.

In this instance, we refactor the code because smaller files could provide faster load times. (I.E. less work on the browser) This also allows viewers of the source code an easier time navigating the source.

I start by using new HTML elements available to us with HTML5. I'm able to create blocks with newly descriptive elements.

If you look at the original CSS code, you see there are several classes that repeat code taking up more space in the file. I consolidate the classes into one class per section to eliminate the repeat code down to fewer CSS declarations.

I've practiced this to ensure in the future I provide clean, non-repetative, and concise code. In real-world application it is constant revisions and practice that makes working tasks like these easier.

This request to refractor was to show this site could use some cleaning, re-work, with the addition of notes.

I've learned a few things while reworking this code: 

```
- Changing div classes to the new HTML element types allows for broader CSS rule-sets. This gives more freedom in CSS specificity.
- Classes can allow you to apply one CSS rule-set to more than one html element.
- Adding comments, visually, really helps the legibility of the code.
```

I believe there is a better way to float the .what-we-do-section that could eliminate another CSS rule-set.

As I continure my education, I will find a better way to eliminate uneccesary code.
